<h1> Hello Everyone! </h1>

I would like to first apologies for all this time I have taken from you wonderful people at DJA. When I was first talking with eric, it was very slow at my job and was hoping to find a new one asap. The moment I was making the project though, My Job put me onto a new project and that took over everything for a total of 5 months. <b> So I do Apologies for the time waste! </b> Now letâ€™s get back to the important part, The project!

<h2> Project Overview </h2>

The project I will be showing you today is a simple website with a registration form

The fields I must provide and validate for this project are:
 * First Name
 * Last Name
 * Email Address + Confirming Email Address 
 * Opt in
 * Google Recaptcha

If any information is wrong/incorrect I will return a validation error to the user and tell them what is wrong.

The user must prove they are not a robot with Google Recaptcha 

When all the data that is provided is validated, I will be sending it to the backend using POST request

I must make sure that the email provided can only submit once time a day, any submissions on the same date with the same email should give an error telling the user they already submitted for the day
<b> I will be using:</b>
PHP 8
AWS Dynamo DB

<h2> The Code and The Code Correction </h2>

Coming Soon
