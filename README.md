# Interview-Web-Reg
This Repo will be used for the interview question asked by eric!

To begin I have uploaded these file and (hopefully) the website is up and running and you can test it !

if the website is not working(hopefully it is) or you would to test the database locally you can! 

--CREATING THE DATABASE--

Sadly, the database is not in dynamo, its in mySQL, to get it to work you must have a XAAMP and run mysql along side the apache launch, once you do that go ahead and open up localhost/phpmyadmin and from there make a database, 
I will provide a file called "SQL_commands.txt". This file has all the SQL commands you need to make:
A database called interview,
A table called customers,
And inserts of testing dummy emails and names that I have supplied!
You don not have to use the dummy inputs, it is just there so you can see that the table is populated
and you can test the ability to re-add some of the accounts already in there!

--GETTING TO THE PAGE--

you can go to localhost and click on this folder and it should bring up the index.php file! enter your info or test 
the program! 

--THANK YOU!!!--
all feed back apprciated and thank you in advance for this oppertunity !
